# Java-Bank-Account-Withdrawal
I designed this program in my Intro to Software Design class. The purpose of this project is to allow a user to withdraw money from their bank account without exceeding the account's balance. If the user attempts to withdraw more money than is available in their account, "Withdrawal amount exceeded account balance." will be displayed.
